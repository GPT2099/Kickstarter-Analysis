# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends by Gordie Thompson for UT Data Analytics Bootcamp 2020

## Overview of Project
The analysis intends to narrow the large dataset into visualizations of the catagories of "Theater/Plays" based on date created and fund raising goals. 

### Purpose
This analysis aims to help Louise determine how different campaigns in the Kickstarter dataset fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was performed on the Kickstarter dataset using basic excel summary and visualization techniques. Filters were applied to the data set to narrow the large field into Louise’s desired interests such as “Theater/Play” categories.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge was finding relevant and comparable campaigns for Louise within such a large and diverse dataset. This difficulty was overcome by filtering campaigns akin to Louise's on such guidlines as fund raising goals, outcomes, country, and subcatagory such as "Plays". 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. The spring/summer months of May through August have the highest amount of launched Kickstarter campaigns.
  2. The most popluar month to launch a campaign is May. May is also historically the most successful month based on the successful/failed campaign ratio. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Campaigns with fund raising goals that stick to $5000 or less tend to be far more successful than larger funding goals.  
  - The chart does suggest an excpetional success rate of almost 70% for the six campaigns with funding goal amounts of 35K-45K. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - test yo

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
